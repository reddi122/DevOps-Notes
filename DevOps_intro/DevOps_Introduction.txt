Introduction to DevOps
SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle):
The SDLC is a process for building software, packages, and applications.

SDLC Models:
1. Waterfall Model:
   - A traditional, linear software development methodology.
   - Follows a sequential process:
     1. Requirement Gathering and Analysis
     2. Design/Planning/Architecture
     3. Implementation/Coding/Development
     4. Testing
     5. Release/Delivery/Deployment
     6. Maintenance/Monitoring/Feedback

   Limitations:
   - Unsuitable for complex projects where frequent changes are needed.
   - Time-consuming as each stage must be completed before moving to the next.
   - No flexibility to revisit previous stages.

2. Agile Model:
   - The project is divided into iterations called sprints (2â€“8 weeks).
   - At the end of each iteration, a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is delivered.

   Limitations:
   - Miscommunication between teams.
   - Configuration changes can create deployment challenges for the operations team.

What is DevOps?
DevOps bridges the gap between development and operations, addressing the limitations of Agile methodology.

Without DevOps Culture:
- Release and deployment mismatches.
- Unpredictable issues.
- Blame games between teams.

With DevOps Culture:
- Streamlined deliveries.
- Collaboration between teams.
- Elimination of blame games.

Key Points:
- DevOps is not a role, person, or separate team.
- DevOps is not just about tools or writing scripts.
- DevOps is a practice that integrates development, testing, deployment, and monitoring into a unified lifecycle.

What Does DevOps Do?
- Integrates development and operations teams.
- Enhances collaboration and productivity through automation.
- Continuously measures application performance and automates workflows.

Skills of a DevOps Engineer:
1. Technical Tools:
   - Version Control: Git
   - Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD): Jenkins
   - Containerization: Docker
   - Configuration Management: Ansible, Chef
   - Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana

2. Networking Skills:
   - Establish connections between containers or manage container orchestration.

3. Soft Skills:
   - Communication, teamwork, and customer service.

DevOps Lifecycle:
1. Plan:
   - Visualize, track, and summarize your project.
   - Examples: Jira, Trello

2. Code:
   - Developers write the code.
   - Examples: Git, GitHub, Bitbucket

3. Build:
   - Build pre-release versions of software.
   - Examples: Apache, Maven

4. Test:
   - Automated testing to identify risks and issues early.
   - Examples: JUnit, Selenium, JMeter

5. Release:
   - Integrate code into a shared repository for error detection.
   - Examples: Bamboo, GitLab, Jenkins

6. Deploy:
   - Manage deployment in various environments.
   - Examples: AWS, Chef, Ansible

7. Operations:
   - Keep systems updated with the latest features.
   - Examples: AWS, Ansible, Chef

8. Monitoring:
   - Ensure application performance and stability. Identify issues quickly.
   - Examples: Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk

Additional Information:
- DevOps Objectives:
   - Speed up software delivery without compromising quality.
   - Reduce manual errors by automating repetitive tasks.
   - Foster a culture of collaboration between teams.

- DevOps Tools Ecosystem:
   - CI/CD Pipeline: Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD
   - Container Orchestration: Kubernetes, OpenShift
   - Cloud Platforms: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform
